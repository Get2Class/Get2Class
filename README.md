## Ideas:
- Fetch schedule from workday (or download and upload CSV of schedule)
- Parse into calendar events (store on DB)
- Button to export as csv for google calendar
- Display nicely
- Button to add and remove (recurring/one-off) events
- Button to show class location
- Button to get walking directions
- Notification when itâ€™s time to walk to class (+5 min to pack up)
- Karma score if you get to class on time and stay the whole time (lose more points the more late you are)

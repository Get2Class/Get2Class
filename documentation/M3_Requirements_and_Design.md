## 2. Project Description
Get2Class is a gamified calendar to help students get to class on time. The main target audience for this app will be UBC students and professors. The main problem we are trying to solve is simplifying the Workday Student calendar as it is unintuitive and difficult to use. We will make it easy to set up your calendar using data from Workday. It can be difficult, especially for first-yearâ€™s, to find your classes using the building acronym on Workday. We will provide maps and walking routes. Additionally, we want to help motivate students to be punctual and attend their classes. Our application aims to solve this by implementing a notification and points system that helps and motivates users to go to classes and provides best routes to reach their next class.

### **3.2. Actors Description**
1. **User**: The User is a student/professor which utilizes the application to help get them to their next class.
2. **Workday API**: The Workday API is the actor which will integrate the user's course schedule into the app. Additionally, this API will be utilized by the "Import and View Schedule" use case.
3. **Google Maps API**: The Google Maps API is the actor which will display locations and routes for the user. Additionally, this API will be utilized by the "Display Route to Class" use case.

1. **User Login and Authentication** 
    - **Overview**:
        1. Sign In to Account: System will allow user to utilize external authentication to login to the app 
    
    - **Detailed Flow for Each Independent Scenario**: 
        1. **Sign In to Account**:
            - **Description**: The user will utilize an external authentication API such as Google Signin API to log themselves into the app as a user.

# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
1. Updated section 3.1, on February 28. 
    - Updated the Use-Case Diagram to use verbs in accordance with M3 feedback.
    - Changed includes to extends to accurately depict relationships.
2. Updated section 3.3-2, on February 28.
    - Removed create schedule use case since this is now done automatically upon account creation.
    - Added language to describe Fall, Winter, Summer schedule format.
    - Changed **import** to **upload** and **delete** to **clear** to accurately depict actions.
    - Changed **csv** to **xlsx** since Workday no longer allows csv download.
    - Removed failure scenario for clear schedule in accordance with M3 feedback.
3. Updated section 3.3-3, on February 28.
    - Removed attendance checking as that is a separate feature.
4. Updated section 3.5-3, on February 28.
    - Added further justification to NFRs 1 and 2 in accordance with M3 feedback.
    - Removed NFR 3 as it was extraneous and not justifiable.
5. Updated section 4, on February 28.
    - Changed **username** to **sub** (subject) in many places as this is the unique identifier provided by Google Authentication that we are using to identify user data in our data bases.
6. Updated section 4.1, on March 2.
    - Removed attendance component as we implemented this component in our frontend
    - Added checkAttendance() interface to frontend.
    - Added Notification component as per M3 feedback and per our implementation plans.
    - Updated User and Schedule component to align with the ScheduleController.ts and UserController.ts functions
7. Updated section 4.5, on March 2.
    - Updated dependency diagram to match changes to section 4.1.

## 2. Project Description
Get2Class is a gamified calendar to help students get to class on time. The main target audience for this app will be UBC students and professors. The main problem we are trying to solve is simplifying the Workday Student calendar as it is unintuitive and difficult to use. We will make it easy to set up your calendar using data from Workday. It can be difficult, especially for first-yearâ€™s, to find your classes using the building acronym on Workday. We will provide maps and walking routes. Additionally, we want to help motivate students to be punctual and attend their classes. Our application aims to solve this by implementing a notification and points system that helps and motivates users to go to classes and provides best routes to reach their next class.

### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2**
    - **Purpose**: Used to host the application's server back end so that the front end application can communicate and exchange data with the APIs and database
    - **Reason**: We need a running EC2 instance (computer) in order to support our client-server architecture 

2. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) API Gateway**
    - **Purpose**: Used to link our EC2 server routes to a central API that the client (front end application) can call
    - **Reason**: AWS API Gateway will help our front end application call the routes on our EC2 through HTTPS rather than HTTP

3. **Docker**
    - **Purpose**: Synchronize our back end server and database to launch and connect together simultaneously
    - **Reason**: Simplifies the process of managing our EC2 instance which hosts all of our back end related technology (e.g. Express and MongoDB)

4. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Stores our model (persistence) layer related to Schedule and User data
    - **Reason**: MongoDB was used in Milestone 1 and will be simple to organize our data in a format that we are already familiar with

5. **Navigation API**
    - **Purpose**: Provides the user live navigation updates as they walk towards their class
    - **Reason**: Navigation API has existing integrations with Kotlin, so implementing the live navigation will be simpler

6. **Places API**
    - **Purpose**: Provides us with the location (exact coordinates) of the class
    - **Reason**: We can use this as a part of our attendance checker to compute the distance between the class and the user location to determine if the student can check in or not

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [**Schedule Usability**](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: We can set up a stopwatch and time how long each operation on the schedule takes. Then we check if the response time is less than 3 seconds.
2. [**Location Accuracy**](#nfr2)
    - **Validation**: We can open the app and check the attendance at different distance (e.g. 50m, 80m, 120m, 150m etc.) away from the location of the next class. Then by checking the attendance and Karma points, we know the location accuracy


### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**Check Attendance**
- **Description**: Check whether a user is in the correct class location at the correct time and manages the karma score of the user accordingly.
- **Why complex?**: This is complex because we have to synchronize all back end components of the app along with the front end Google Maps API. We must utilize the location of the user, the location of the classroom, the time the class starts (obtained from the Schedule DB), the time of the user, and adjust the karma score to give to the user based on several cases.
- **Design**:
    - **Input**: The course to be checked, the term of the schedule it came from, and the sub of the user.
    - **Output**: A message will be provided back to the front end for the client. The back end will update the karma based on the conditions.
    - **Main computational logic**:
        - Conditional cases for determining which check in status to provide for the user:
            - If the class is not in this term or this year, notify the user
            - If the class has already been marked as attended, notify the user
            - If it is before the class by more than 10 minutes, they are too early
            - If it is after the class, they are too late
            - If they are more than 75 meters from the class location, they are marked as in the wrong location
            - If it is mid way through the class, they are late. Mark the class as attended and add less karma according to how late they are then mark the class as attended
            - Otherwise, they are considered on time for up to 2 minutes and they will be marked as attended and will be awarded the full number of karma 
        - Class attendance will reset at the end of every day
    - **Pseudo-code**:
        ```
        String checkAttendance(course, term, sub):
            requestLocationUpdates()
            clientTime = getCurrentTime()
            clientDate = getCurrentDate()
            clientLocation = requestCurrentLocation()
            if(!checkTermAndYear(course, term)):
                return "You don't have this class this term"
            if (clientDate < 1 || clientDate > 5 || !course.days[clientDate - 1])
                return "You don't have this class today"
            if (course.attended):
                return "You already signed in to this class today!"
            elif (clientTime < course.startTime - 10):
                return "You are too early!"
            elif (course.endTime <= clientTime):
                return "You missed class!"
            elif (75 < coordinatesToDistance(clientLocation, course.location)):
                return "You are not in the correct location!"
            elif (course.startTime < clientTime - 2):
                int lateness = clientTime - course.startTime
                int classLength = course.endTime - course.startTime
                int karma = (10 * (1 - lateness / classLength) * (course.credits + 1))
                updateKarma(sub, karma)
                updateAttendance(sub, course, true)
                return "You were late to class!"
            else:
                updateKarma(sub, 15 * (course.credits + 1))
                updateAttendance(sub, course, true)
                return "Welcome to class!"

        clearAttendance():
            allSchedules = await getAllSchedules();

            for (i = 0; i < allSchedules.length; i++):
                if (allSchedules[i]["fallCourseList"].length != 0):
                    for (j = 0; j < allSchedules[i]["fallCourseList"].length; j++):
                        allSchedules[i]["fallCourseList"][j]["attended"] = false

                if (allSchedules[i]["winterCourseList"].length != 0):
                    for (j = 0; j < allSchedules[i]["winterCourseList"].length; j++):
                        allSchedules[i]["winterCourseList"][j]["attended"] = false

                if (allSchedules[i]["summerCourseList"].length != 0):
                    for (j = 0; j < allSchedules[i]["summerCourseList"].length; j++):
                        allSchedules[i]["summerCourseList"][j]["attended"] = false


            for (i = 0; i < allSchedules.length; i++):
                updatedData = updateSchedule(allSchedules[i])
        ```

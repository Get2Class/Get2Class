## 2. Project Description
Get2Class is a gamified calendar to help students get to class on time. The main target audience for this app will be UBC students and professors. The main problem we are trying to solve is simplifying the Workday Student calendar as it is unintuitive and difficult to use. We will make it easy to set up your calendar using data from Workday. It can be difficult, especially for first-yearâ€™s, to find your classes using the building acronym on Workday. We will provide maps and walking routes. Additionally, we want to help motivate students to be punctual and attend their classes. Our application aims to solve this by implementing a notification and points system that helps and motivates users to go to classes and provides best routes to reach their next class.

### **3.2. Actors Description**
1. **User**: The User is a student/professor which utilizes the application to help get them to their next class.
2. **Workday API**: The Workday API is the actor which will integrate the user's course schedule into the app. Additionally, this API will be utilized by the "Import and View Schedule" use case.
3. **Google Maps API**: The Google Maps API is the actor which will display locations and routes for the user. Additionally, this API will be utilized by the "Display Route to Class" use case.

1. **User Login and Authentication** 
    - **Overview**:
        1. Sign In to Account: System must allow user to utilize external authentication to login to the app 
    
    - **Detailed Flow for Each Independent Scenario**: 
        1. **Sign In to Account**:
            - **Description**: The user will utilize an external authentication API such as Google Sign In API to log themselves into the app with their credentials as a user.
            - **Primary actor(s)**: User (Student/Professor) 
            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. User will click on the Google Sign In button
                2. A popup/rerouting of the page will occur providing the user a screen to enter their Google credentials into a box
                3. Once the user hits the Login button they will then be routed to the home page of the application
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 2a. The user enters invalid credentials
                    - 2a1. The app routes the user back to log in screen
                    - 2a2. An error message is displayed telling the user of the error (e.g. error getting credentials)
                    - 2a3. The app prompts the user to try to log in again
    
2. **Import and View Schedule**
    - **Overview**:
        1. Create Schedule: The system must allow the user to generate a blank schedule
        2. Import Schedule: The system must allow the user to import their schedule from Workday
        3. View Schedule: The system must allow the user to view their schedule in a clear and understandable format
        4. Delete Schedule: The system must allow the user to delete an existing schedule
    
    - **Detailed Flow for Each Independent Scenario**:
        1. **Create Schedule**:
            - **Description**: The user can create a blank schedule with a name
            - **Primary actor(s)**: User (Student/Professor)
            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. The user clicks on the Add Schedule button
                2. The app prompts the user to enter a name for the new schedule
                3. Once the user enters the name, they will hit the Create button, the newly created schdule shows up on the screen
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 2a. The user enters an empty string for the schedule name
                    - 2a1. An error message is displayed telling the user that the schedule name cannot be empty
                    - 2a2. The app prompts the user to enter a valid name again
                - 2b. The user enters a schedule name that conflicts with an already existing schedule name
                    - 2b1. An error message is displayed telling the user that the name has been used previously
                    - 2b2. The app prompts the user to enter a new name
                - 2c. The user enters illegal characters into the schedule name
                    - 2c1. An error message is displayed telling the user that the schedule name does not meet the criteria of the schedule naming convention
                    - 2c2. The app prompts the user to enter a valid schedule name

        2. **Import Schedule**:
            - **Description**: The user can import their own schdule from Workday onto a blank existing schedule the user has created
            - **Primary actor(s)**: User (Student/Professor) and Workday API

                1. The user clicks on a an already existing blank schedule they have created
                2. The user will then click on the Import Schedule button
                3. A popup or page reroute will occur requesting the user to upload a (valid) .csv file (from Workday)
                4. Once the user successfully uploads a .csv file of their schedule, the blank schedule will become populated with the users imported schedule 
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 3a. The user uploads a non-valid or non .csv file
                    - 3a1. An error message is displayed telling the user that the uploaded file is not valid

                2. The app opens up the schedule for the user to view
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - N/A

        4. **Delete Schedule**:
            - **Description**: The user can delete their existing schedules

                2. The app pops up a warning message for deleting the selected schedule
                3. If the user hits Confirm, the app deletes the schedule and the warning is dismissed
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 3a. The user hits Cancel or elsewhere
                    - 3a1. The warning message is dismissed

                3. The user sees their current location and destination location together with the optimal route on the screen
                4. When the user arrives (or their next class happens at their current location), the user gains or loses points (karma) based on their punctuality
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 2a. The user does not grant location permissions
                    - 2a1. The app prompts the user for permissions again with rationale
                    - 2a2. If the user denies twice, the app shows a dialog to tell the user to enable location permissions in the settings first
                    - 2a3. The app routes the user back to the previous screen

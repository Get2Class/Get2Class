# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
<!-- Leave blank for M3 -->

## 2. Project Description
Get2Class is a gamified calendar to help students get to class on time. The main target audience for this app will be UBC students and professors. The main problem we are trying to solve is simplifying the Workday Student calendar as it is unintuitive and difficult to use. We will make it easy to set up your calendar using data from Workday. It can be difficult, especially for first-yearâ€™s, to find your classes using the building acronym on Workday. We will provide maps and walking routes. Additionally, we want to help motivate students to be punctual and attend their classes. Our application aims to solve this by implementing a notification and points system that helps and motivates users to go to classes and provides best routes to reach their next class.

                2. The app pops up a warning message for deleting the selected schedule
                3. If the user hits Confirm, the app deletes the schedule and the warning is dismissed
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 3a. The user hits Cancel or elsewhere
                    - 3a1. The warning message is dismissed

### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2**
    - **Purpose**: Used to host the application's server back end so that the front end application can communicate and exchange data with the APIs and database
    - **Reason**: We need a running EC2 instance (computer) in order to support our client-server architecture 

2. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) API Gateway**
    - **Purpose**: Used to link our EC2 server routes to a central API that the client (front end application) can call
    - **Reason**: AWS API Gateway will help our front end application call the routes on our EC2 through HTTPS rather than HTTP

3. **Docker**
    - **Purpose**: Synchronize our back end server and database to launch and connect together simultaneously
    - **Reason**: Simplifies the process of managing our EC2 instance which hosts all of our back end related technology (e.g. Express and MongoDB)

4. **MongoDB**

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [**Schedule Usability**](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: We can set up a stopwatch and time how long each operation on the schedule takes. Then we check if the response time is less than 3 seconds.
2. [**Location Accuracy**](#nfr2)
    - **Validation**: We can open the app and check the attendance at different distance (e.g. 50m, 80m, 120m, 150m etc.) away from the location of the next class. Then by checking the attendance and Karma points, we know the location accuracy
3. [**Route Accessibility**](#nfr3)
    - **Validation**: We log in to our app and navigate to an arbitrary screen. Then we can test if we can get the route suggestions in 5 clicks or fewer


### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**Check Attendance**
- **Description**: Check whether a user is in the correct class location at the correct time and manages the karma score of the user accordingly.
- **Why complex?**: This is complex because we have to synchronize all back end components of the app along with the front end Google Maps API. We must utilize the location of the user, the location of the classroom, the time the class starts (obtained from the Schedule DB), the time of the user, and adjust the karma score to give to the user based on several cases.
- **Design**:
    - **Input**: The client's username, the client's current location as GPS coordinates, the client's current time, and the schedule ID the user is interacting with. 
    - **Output**: A message will be provided back to the front end for the client. The back end will update the karma based on the conditions.
    - **Main computational logic**:
        - Determining the class which the user is checking into: If a class is currently taking place or starting in less than 10 minutes, we will select this as the class that the user wants to check into. Otherwise, we will select whichever class is closest in time.
        - Conditional cases for determining which check in status to provide for the user:
            - If the class has already been marked as attended, notify the user
            - If it is before the class by more than 10 minutes, they are too early
            - If it is after the class, they are too late
            - If they are more than 50 meters from the class location, they are marked as in the wrong location
            - If it is mid way through the class, they are late. Mark the class as attended and add less karma according to how late they are
            - Otherwise, they are considered on time for up to 10 minutes and they will be marked as attended and will be awarded the full number of karma 
        - Class attendance will reset at the end of every day
    - **Pseudo-code**:
        ```
        String checkAttendance(username, userCoordinates, userTime, id):
            Class currClass = null
            Schedule s = Schedule.getSpecificSchedule(id)
            
            if (userTime < s[0].start - 10):
                currClass = s[0]
            
            for i in range(sizeOf(s) - 1):
                Class c1 = s[i]
                Class c2 = s[i + 1]
                
                // It is before or during the first class
                if (userTime < c1.end):
                    currClass = c1
                
                // It is between the two classes

## 2. Project Description
Get2Class is a gamified calendar to help students get to class on time. The main target audience for this app will be UBC students and professors. The main problem we are trying to solve is simplifying the Workday Student calendar as it is unintuitive and difficult to use. We will make it easy to set up your calendar using data from Workday. It can be difficult, especially for first-yearâ€™s, to find your classes using the building acronym on Workday. We will provide maps and walking routes. Additionally, we want to help motivate students to be punctual and attend their classes. Our application aims to solve this by implementing a notification and points system that helps and motivates users to go to classes and provides best routes to reach their next class.

### **3.4. Screen Mockups**
N/A

### **3.5. Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Schedule Usability** <a name="nfr1"></a>
    - **Description**: All schedules operations (upload, view, clear) should be processed and reflected on the screen within 3 seconds of the user action
    - **Justification**: Quick schedule display avoids user dissatisfaction and saves time for busy professors and students to check the time and location for their upcoming classes. According to https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks.pdf, as page load time goes from 1s to 3s, the probability of bounce increases 32%.
2. **Location Accuracy** <a name="nfr2"></a>
    - **Description**: The user's location should be track within a radius of 50 meters from the actual location
    - **Justification**: Accurate location tracking helps provide the optimal route, which is important for professors and students to get to class on time. This also ensures fairness for awarding and deducting points (karma). Our testing found that inside buildings on campus you can be up to 50m away from the building's google maps location, so we need precise location data to keep the valid radius small.

### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2**
    - **Purpose**: Used to host the application's server back end so that the front end application can communicate and exchange data with the APIs and database
    - **Reason**: We need a running EC2 instance (computer) in order to support our client-server architecture 

2. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) API Gateway**
    - **Purpose**: Used to link our EC2 server routes to a central API that the client (front end application) can call
    - **Reason**: AWS API Gateway will help our front end application call the routes on our EC2 through HTTPS rather than HTTP

3. **Docker**
    - **Purpose**: Synchronize our back end server and database to launch and connect together simultaneously
    - **Reason**: Simplifies the process of managing our EC2 instance which hosts all of our back end related technology (e.g. Express and MongoDB)

4. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Stores our model (persistence) layer related to Schedule and User data
    - **Reason**: MongoDB was used in Milestone 1 and will be simple to organize our data in a format that we are already familiar with

5. **Firebase Cloud Messaging API**
    - **Purpose**: Provides push notifications for users for when they should leave for their classes 
    - **Reason**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) already has existing integrations with Android applications, so this will simplify the implementation process for notifications

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [**Schedule Usability**](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: We can set up a stopwatch and time how long each operation on the schedule takes. Then we check if the response time is less than 3 seconds.
2. [**Location Accuracy**](#nfr2)
    - **Validation**: We can open the app and check the attendance at different distance (e.g. 50m, 80m, 120m, 150m etc.) away from the location of the next class. Then by checking the attendance and Karma points, we know the location accuracy


### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**Check Attendance**
- **Description**: Check whether a user is in the correct class location at the correct time and manages the karma score of the user accordingly.
- **Why complex?**: This is complex because we have to synchronize all back end components of the app along with the front end Google Maps API. We must utilize the location of the user, the location of the classroom, the time the class starts (obtained from the Schedule DB), the time of the user, and adjust the karma score to give to the user based on several cases.
- **Design**:
    - **Input**: The client's sub, the client's current location as GPS coordinates, the client's current time, and the schedule ID the user is interacting with. 
    - **Output**: A message will be provided back to the front end for the client. The back end will update the karma based on the conditions.
    - **Main computational logic**:
        - Determining the class which the user is checking into: If a class is currently taking place or starting in less than 10 minutes, we will select this as the class that the user wants to check into. Otherwise, we will select whichever class is closest in time.
        - Conditional cases for determining which check in status to provide for the user:
            - If the class has already been marked as attended, notify the user
            - If it is before the class by more than 10 minutes, they are too early
            - If it is after the class, they are too late
            - If they are more than 50 meters from the class location, they are marked as in the wrong location
            - If it is mid way through the class, they are late. Mark the class as attended and add less karma according to how late they are
            - Otherwise, they are considered on time for up to 10 minutes and they will be marked as attended and will be awarded the full number of karma 
        - Class attendance will reset at the end of every day
    - **Pseudo-code**:
        ```
        String checkAttendance(course, term, sub):
            requestLocationUpdates()
            clientTime = getCurrentTime()
            clientDate = getCurrentDate()
            clientLocation = requestCurrentLocation()
            if(!checkTermAndYear(course, term)):
                return "You don't have this class this term"
            if (clientDate < 1 || clientDate > 5 || !course.days[clientDate - 1])
                return "You don't have this class today"
            if (course.attended):
                return "You already signed in to this class today!"
            elif (clientTime < course.startTime - 10):
                return "You are too early!"
            elif (course.endTime <= clientTime):
                return "You missed class!"
            elif (75 < coordinatesToDistance(clientLocation, course.location)):
                return "You are not in the correct location!"
            elif (course.startTime < clientTime):
                int lateness = clientTime - course.startTime
                int classLength = course.endTime - course.startTime
                int karma = (10 * (1 - lateness / classLength) * (course.credits + 1))
                updateKarma(sub, karma)
                updateAttendance(sub, course, true)
                return "You were late to class!"
            else:
                updateKarma(sub, 15 * (course.credits + 1))
                updateAttendance(sub, course, true)
                return "Welcome to class!"

        
            cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', async () => {
                try {
                    const allSchedules = await client.db("get2class").collection("schedules").find().toArray();
                    console.log(allSchedules);
